# solve

With a generalized [Solver](/core/solvers) one has the capability to settle intents on the [Router](/core/routers) with multiple accounts that are working to power their own key pieces of functionality. This means, that instead of a single monolithic algorithm to solve for every edge case there are multiple variants running to power each key piece of logic.

With this though, the core onchain functionality of a [Solver](/core/solvers) stems from the [Router](/core/routers) itself.
